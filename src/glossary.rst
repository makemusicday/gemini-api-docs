Glossary
========

Within Gemini_, there are various terms that are used interchangeably:

artist
  This is used somewhat interchangably with ``performer``. They are also functionally
  equivalent, however, as with cities, the term ``artist`` is used by the API uniquely.

city
  This could denote an actual city or a larger region that is operating together. While
  generally, each actual city will have it's own unique requirements and restrictions
  around public festivals, there are cases where a lower population or geographic
  proximity made sense for a festival to be organized across a few cities. Cities are
  sometimes referred to as regional ``chapters``, but for all intents and purposes,
  both chapters and cities are equivalent within Gemini_ and only the term ``city`` is used.

event
  Any performance in the system is referred to as an ``event``.

venue
  Often times, a ``venue`` is referred to as a ``location``, but within the API, it is
  always called a ``venue``.
